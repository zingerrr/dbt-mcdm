### Report:

#### Tools, that i used:
- Snowflake 
- dbt Cloud (changes in 'new' branch)
- Looker Studio ([dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/a500a724-9804-4873-94f9-1f31ca042cf7))

#### Problems:
##### Some datasources doesn't get needed fields of data to calculate some metrics
- There's no such specific data for Twitter, which could be used for conversion, to calculate conversion cost. To solve this 
problem we need data, that can be identified as target action based on the ad (purchase, install, etc.)
- There's no data for TikTok and Bing, which could be determined as engage, to calculate cost per engage. To solve this 
problem we need data, that can be some engagement. For example, for TikTok it can be some interaction with post, session
duration, for Bing it can be bounce rate, time of scrolling, navigating and so on.
